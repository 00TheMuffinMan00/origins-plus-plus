Origins++ is a collection of more than 100 origins to fully expand the origins experience.

## Building 
- This repository contains the shared resources for the Fabric and Forge versions.
- To build the project, go to either the [Fabric Workspace](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-fabric) or the [Forge Workspace](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-forge).
  
## Mod Loader Support 
- Fabric is supported as the main mod-loader and if issues are present on the Fabric version, they are very likely to be fixed.
- Quilt is supported as the Fabric version should be compatible, but any Quilt-specific bugs are likely issues with Origins (Fabric) itself, so bugs may or may not be fixed.
- Forge is supported on a best-effort basis as many issues are Forge-exclusive and issues with Origins (Forge) itself, so bugs may or may not be fixed.

## Credits
- All credit for the origins goes to the [original authors](https://gist.github.com/QuantumXenon/a5639e49221abdb1dcd9009bcafa8a98).
